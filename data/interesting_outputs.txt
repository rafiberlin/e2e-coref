PrisonPlanet: Sorry . %emoji @PrisonPlanet

Comment : In the Patrick's paper, it would be either an error in the category Anaphora and / or
Similar words. I think it should be actually quite easy to reconcile Trump with username @realDonaldTrump,
as Trump has been the topic of many twets the last years...

Comment: In the Patrick's paper, it would be either an error in the category Anaphora and / or
Similar words. Similarly to the previous error, but this time, it cannot reconcile the username of the Speaker
markpoltics4u with I and then later with Mark

2 examples to be observed together:

Ex 1:
33 pred: 1 gold: 0
I    ==    fam
...
taani98: @laurenxjessica @BTSRequest @BTS_twt Can u send this to me !? I love it
...
AyyyRee: the link %emoji https://t.co/wklMz4wdTY @AyyyRee
q_sera83: @AyyyRee @taani98 @laurenxjessica @BTSRequest @BTS_twt Excuse fam . .
... ( 33 )

Ex 2:

15 pred: 0 gold: 1
I    ==    fam
...
AyyyRee: The gif ? It 's in the gif search but I 'll just
...
AyyyRee: the link %emoji https://t.co/wklMz4wdTY @AyyyRee
q_sera83: @AyyyRee @taani98 @laurenxjessica @BTSRequest @BTS_twt Excuse fam . .
... ( 15 )


Comment: This is a typical example where a machine learning algorithms are falling short.
"@AyyyRee @taani98 @laurenxjessica @BTSRequest @BTS_twt" should all be considered as member
of a family  ("fam"). Hence, each user listed in this "fam" using "I" should be considered as belonging
to the same entity  by transitivity. However, this is not the case here.
The trained embeddings cannot capture such context...

season    ==    season
...
oiler99: change his mind about the coach by the end of season . Like Marc Bergrvin with Michel Therrien then to Claude Julien at season 's end
... ( 13 )


Comment: this error is interesting because the mention from my perspective should be "end of season"
/ "season 's end" => Annotation of the twiconv set was partially done by hand partially automatically => no dataset is perfect

idols    ==    Hes
...
ChampionsLeague: incredible to know that I am going to live with idols ; players
...
EbadianVII: give him too much credit @EbadianVII
zreik_: @EbadianVII @hashbrown711 @ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona @Phil_Coutinho Hes gon na
... ( 47 )

Comment : Typical case of "noisy data". "Hes" should be "He's". Then, it would have been easy,
not to link it with the plural noun "idols"

Ex 1.

I    ==    your
...
AmberBobamber: of drugs will change that . -LRB- That said , I 'm still

AmberBobamber: But you have to figure out what is REALLY causing your depression and

Ex.2
38 pred: 1 gold: 0
I    ==    you
...
AmberBobamber: @jmwallach @ParkerMolloy @johannhari101 Oh , keep taking your SSRIs . I take mine
...
jmwallach: sufficient ? @jmwallach
AmberBobamber: @jmwallach @ParkerMolloy @johannhari101 If , for example , you 're married
... ( 38 )

Comment: In these 2 cases, the "I" and "you" or "your" should not be marked as postivie
coreference arc => the utterances come from same user. Speaker info was not able to overcome that...
