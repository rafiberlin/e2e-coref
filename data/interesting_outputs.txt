Comment : In the Patrick's paper, it would be either an error in the category Anaphora and / or
Similar words. I think it should be actually quite easy to reconcile Trump with username @realDonaldTrump,
as Trump has been the topic of many twets the last years...

Comment: In the Patrick's paper, it would be either an error in the category Anaphora and / or
Similar words. Similarly to the previous error, but this time, it cannot reconcile the username of the Speaker
markpoltics4u with I and then later with Mark

Comment: This is a typical example where a machine learning algorithms are falling short.
"@AyyyRee @taani98 @laurenxjessica @BTSRequest @BTS_twt" should all be considered as member
of a family  ("fam"). Hence, each user listed in this "fam" using "I" should be considered as belonging
to the same entity  by transitivity. However, this is not the case here.
The trained embeddings cannot capture such context...

oiler99: change his mind about the coach by the end of season . Like Marc Bergrvin with Michel Therrien then to Claude Julien at season 's end
... ( 13 )


Comment: this error is interesting because the mention from my perspective should be "end of season"
/ "season 's end" => Annotation of the twiconv set was partially done by hand partially automatically => no dataset is perfect

Comment : Typical case of "noisy data". "Hes" should be "He's". Then, it would have been easy,
not to link it with the plural noun "idols"

Comment: In these 2 cases, the "I" and "you" or "your" should not be marked as postivie
coreference arc => the utterances come from same user. Speaker info was not able to overcome that...
